## **Python Tic-Tac-Toe**

This project is a **Python implementation** of the classic board game "Tic-Tac-Toe". The game is designed to be played in the console against a computer opponent.

## **Features**

- **Single-player game**: You will be playing against the computer, which randomly plays its moves.
- **Game rules**: The game ends when either team achieves placing three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board becomes full but no team has won, then a tie will be called.
- **Player input**: You can play by entering a number from 1 to 9. The number you choose corresponds to where your symbol will be put down.

## **Techniques and Skills**

1. **Python Programming**: The game is entirely written in Python.
2. **Random Module**: The `random` module is used to make the computer's moves unpredictable.
3. **Functions**: The game logic is divided into several functions for better organization and readability.
4. **Global Variables**: Global variables are used to maintain the state of the game.
5. **Control Structures**: Control structures like loops and conditionals are used to control the flow of the game.
6. **Input/Output**: The `input` function is used to get the player's move and the `print` function is used to display the game board and messages.

## **To run the game, follow these steps:**

- Ensure that **Python 3** is installed on your machine. You can check this by running python --version in your terminal/command prompt. If Python is correctly installed, you should see your Python version.
- Clone the repository or download the Python file containing the game code.
- Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
- Run the command python filename.py, replacing “filename” with the name of the Python file.
- The game will prompt you to enter a number from 1 to 9 for your move. Enter a number and the game will start.
- The current player can enter their move by typing a number from 1 to 9. The game will automatically move the player’s piece and handle the game logic. The first player to reach three in a row wins the game.
